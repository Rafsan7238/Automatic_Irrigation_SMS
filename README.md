# Automatic Irrigation System with SMS Updates

For our CSE360 final lab project, we propose to build an “Automatic Irrigation System with SMS 
Updates”. This is a software-based simulation project which aims to automate the irrigation process 
using an ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor, GSM module and Arduino microcontroller. The ultrasonic sensor 
will be used to measure the water level in a tank and whenever, it goes below a certain level, a tank 
motor will be turned on to fill up tank and turned off when it is full. The soil moisture sensor picks 
up the moisture of the soil and if it goes below a certain threshold, a water pump will pump water to 
the crops. Moreover, we will also use a humidity and temperature sensor to give farmers an idea of 
the environmental condition to help them decide on harvesting at the right time. These can be 
viewed on an LCD screen. Along with this, the farmers will also receive updates when their motors 
are turned on or off via SMS through a GSM module. We will also build a GUI with LabVIEW to 
log data and visualise the changes.
